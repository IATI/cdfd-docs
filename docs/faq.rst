.. _faq_1: 

\1. What data is included in CDFD?
    Data published to the `International Aid Transparency Initiative <https://iatistandard.org/en/>`_ (IATI). These data come from the `IATI Registry <https://www.iatiregistry.org/>`_.

.. _faq_2: 

\2. When is CDFD updated?
    CDFD is refreshed once per day. 
    Individual reporting organisations update their data at different frequencies, such as monthy, quarterly, or annually. 

.. _faq_3:

\3. Why is there missing data?
    Data gaps likely indicate that an organisation has not included this information in their data. 
    This may be due to differing levels of detail, or due to different update schedules.
    In the outputs, any data gaps appear as 'No data' in the cells.

.. _faq_4:

\4. Where can I access bulk downloads?
    We are currently working to improve access to bulk downloads of CDFD's outputs from the web interface. 
    While this work is ongoing, bulk downloads can be found at the following links:

    * `EN_CDFD.zip <https://cdfd.iati.opendataservices.coop/output/web/xlsx/cdfd-xlsx-files-en.zip>`_
    * `FR_CDFD.zip <https://cdfd.iati.opendataservices.coop/output/web/xlsx/cdfd-xlsx-files-fr.zip>`_
    * `ES_CDFD.zip <https://cdfd.iati.opendataservices.coop/output/web/xlsx/cdfd-xlsx-files-es.zip>`_
    * `PT_CDFD.zip <https://cdfd.iati.opendataservices.coop/output/web/xlsx/cdfd-xlsx-files-pt.zip>`_

    Note that this is a prototype service. There may be a delay of ~24-36 hours before recently published data is incorporated into these aggregate results.
