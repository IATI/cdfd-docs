Country Development Finance Data
******************************************************

Country Development Finance Data (CDFD) provides summaries of International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) data in a simple, downloadable spreadsheet format. 
These summaries include projects and spend by country, region, reporting organisation, and sector.

We recommend CDFD for:

* Partner country governments who want to analyse external development finance relevant to their country
* Civil society organisations or providers of development finance who want to explore IATI data in a simple, dashboard format.
